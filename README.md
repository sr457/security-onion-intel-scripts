# security-onion-intel-scripts
Scripts for collecting/creating intel and/or modifying various SO intel files including OSSEC and Bro

modIntel.py and modIntel.conf are used to add and remove intel from Bro and OSSEC intel files.  The script also does some house keeping on all the intel files including backups, duplicate removal, and honoring OSSEC /24 IP ranges.
